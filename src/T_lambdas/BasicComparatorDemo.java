/*
The Comparator interface is a functional interface. It has
many non-abstract methods, but only two abstract methods,
one of which is the equals method (which doesn't count,
since it's found in the Object class). A lambda expression
that is an instance of Comparator is a function that has
the ability to compare two objects and determine their order.

    // Here's how we created a Comparator previously, using an anonymous class:
    // Comparator<String> byLength = new Comparator<>() {
    //     @Override
    //     public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
    //         return Integer.compare(s1.length(), s2.length());
    //     }
    // };

    // Now we can do it much more concisely, using a lambda expression:
    // Comparator<String> byLength = (s1, s2) -> Integer.compare(s1.length(), s2.length());

    // Using the Comparator.comparing(Function keyExtractor) method:
    // Comparator<String> byLength = Comparator.comparing(s -> s.length());

    // Now with a method reference instead of a lambda expression:
    // Comparator<String> byLength = Comparator.comparing(String::length);

    // Arrays.sort(arr, byLength);
    // IO.println("sorted by length: " + Arrays.toString(arr));

    // Using the thenComparing(Comparator other) method
