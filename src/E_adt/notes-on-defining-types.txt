Records, classes, abstract classes, and interfaces are language mechanisms
for defining new types.

Every language feature has:
 - syntax: grammar rules
 - semantics: meaning

Semantics of a record: an immutable, transparent carrier of data.
Example:
record Point(int x, int y) {}

Semantics of a class:
1. a possibly-mutable carrier of data.
   Example: StringBuilder
   Another example:
   class BankAccount {
       private int balance = 0;

       public void deposit(int amount) {
           balance += amount;
       }
   }
2. a processor (the user doesn't care about the data, just the behavior).
   Example: Scanner
   Another example:
   class Averager {
       private double sum = 0;
       private int count = 0;

       public void add(double x) {
           sum += x;
           count++;
       }

       public double average() {
           return sum / count;
       }
   }

Semantics of an abstract class: a partial implementation:
- has some instance fields, but others are deferred to subclasses;
- has some concrete methods, and also some abstract methods whose implementation is deferred to subclasses.

Semantics of an interface:
1. The specification of an ADT with multiple potential implementations that have
   the same external behavior.
   Example: Distance, implemented by DistanceM and DistanceK. DistanceM
   and DistanceK objects can be used interchangeably, since they have the same
   external behavior, though their implementation details differ.
2. The specification of an ADT with multiple potential implementations that may
   have different behavior.
   Example: Shape, implemented by Circle and Rectangle. A Circle cannot be used in
   place of a Rectangle, and vice versa, though they both are kinds of Shape.
3. The specification of a common property or behavior that is exhibited by many
   non-related types of objects. For example, consider:
   class Animal {}
   interface Edible {}
   class Chicken extends Animal implements Edible {}
   class Apple implements Edible {}
   It doesn't make sense for Chicken and Apple to have a common superclass, since
   they don't have much in common. However, they both have the property of being edible.
   So we make Chicken and Apple implement an Edible interface.
   Question: why not just make Edible a class instead of an interface?
   Answer: If Edible would be a class, then Chicken wouldn't be able to inherit from
   both Animal and Edible.
   Question: why not make Animal inherit from Edible?
   Answer: not all animals are considered edible.
   Another example: Comparable, which is implemented by classes such as String,
   Integer, File, LocalDate etc. We will discuss Comparable in detail later.
