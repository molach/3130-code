============================ The Comparable<T> interface =====================================

Many unrelated types of objects have the common property of being comparable.
"Comparable" means that given a and b, a is either less than b, greater than b,
or equal to b.

For example, Strings are comparable, so if we have any Strings s1 and s2 it
must be that either
- s1 is less than (alphabetically before) s2, or
- s1 is greater than (alphabetically after) s2, or
- s1 is equal to s2.

Similarly, Integers are comparable, LocalDates are comparable, etc.
For example, if d1 and d2 are LocalDates, it must be that either
- d1 is less than (chronologically before) d2, or
- d1 is greater than (chronologically after) d2, or
- d1 is equal to d2.

By contrast, two Scanners are not comparable: there's no notion of
"less than" or "greater than" for Scanners.

The String, LocalDate, and Integer classes (and many more) implement the
Comparable interface, which specifies a method named compareTo.
The call a.compareTo(b) returns:
- a negative int if a is before/less than b
- a positive int if a is after/greater than b
- 0 if a and b are equal.

We say that the Comparable interface and its compareTo method provide the
"natural order" for objects. For example,
the natural order of Strings is alphabetical,
the natural order of Integers is numeric order,
the natural order of LocalDates is chronological.
These orders are expressed in the compareTo method of those classes.

============================ The Comparator<T> interface =====================================

Suppose we would like to compare objects that don't have a natural order.
Or suppose we would like to compare objects that have a natural order in some other way.
For example, suppose we would like to compare Strings by length instead of alphabetically.
To do this, we create an object that inherits from the Comparator interface.
This interface has a method named compare that takes two objects as input
and returns an int: negative, positive, or 0, like the compareTo method.

Suppose c refers to an object that inherits from the Comparator interface.
Then c.compare(a, b) returns:
- a negative int if a is before/less than b
- a positive int if a is after/greater than b
- 0 if a and b are equal.

==============================================================================================

compareTo vs. compare:

compareTo:
- To call compareTo, we say s1.compareTo(s2).
- The compareTo method is built into the objects that we want to compare.
- The compareTo method has one parameter.

compare:
- To call compare, once we have a Comparator c, we say c.compare(s1, s2).
- The compare method is not built into the objects that we are trying to compare;
  rather, it is part of an external Comparator.
- The compare method has two parameters: the two objects that the Comparator is being asked to compare.

Comparable vs Comparator:
- A Comparable can compare itself to another object, e.g., "e".compareTo("y")
- A Comparator can compare two objects, e.g., byLength.compare("e", "y")

When should you implement Comparable? When you're writing a class whose objects
you'd like to be comparable with each other.

When should you implement Comparator?
1. When you want to compare objects of a class that doesn't implement Comparable
2. When you want to compare objects in a different way than their compareTo method specifies.
